# Kubernetes_RFD

```
Multiple Kubernetes projects for all kinds of problems.
```



## Prerequisites

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster available.

If you do not have one, you can virtualize with tools such as minikube in version v1.16.0 or higher. https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube

All the images that will be used in this repository have been generated by dockerfile or similar files from the following repository: https://github.com/JoseManuelPS/Docker_RFD

It is recommended to have a proprietary image repository such as Docker Registry or Nexus to facilitate the image management task.



## ansible

minikube mount ~/projects:/home/docker/projects
